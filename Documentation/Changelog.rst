.. _version-0-46-1:

Version 0.46.1 (2026-11-14)
===========================

Fixes the "Technical backend user" select of the A2A client record form on
MySQL and MariaDB. Since 0.45.0 the form showed a database error and listed no
users there, so an administrator could not create a client in the record form.
No database schema or extension setting change. Details in the repository
:file:`CHANGELOG.md`.
